# Survey Form

## Project Description

This web application creates a survey form that collects user input on various topics.  It was built to practice and demonstrate skills in HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript for form handling.  This project focuses on front-end development and provides a practical example of building interactive forms for data collection.

## Key Features

*   **User Input:** The form allows users to input data into various fields, including text, email, numbers, dropdown menus, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a textarea for comments.
*   **Data Validation:**  The form uses HTML5 validation to ensure data integrity, such as requiring specific fields and validating email format.
*   **Organized Layout:** The form is designed with a clear and user-friendly layout, making it easy for users to understand and complete the survey.
*   **Accessibility Considerations:**  The form is built with accessibility in mind, using proper labels and semantic HTML elements.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML
*   CSS
*   JavaScript (Optional - for enhanced form handling or interactivity)
